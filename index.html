                Welcome to my page! My name is Marie Matisans and I am a Full Stack Developer. I love to create and organize content while maintaining a high level of ease and functionality to pages. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A little about me:
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a military brat, born in Italy. I have also lived in England and Virginia. I spent my childhood travelling all over Europe and the U.S. 
                Despite never having been to Texas, I moved from Virginia in 2018 with my husband, cat and dog to Austin, Texas. It has been the best decision we have ever made!

                My hobbies include, but are not limited to: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arts and crafts - I mainly design and build clothing and accessories but will dabble in anything artsy.</li>
                <li>Fitness - lifting, hiking, hot yoga, swimming... you name it and I'll be there!</li>
                <li>Food - I am allergic to gluten and dairy and there is no way I'm going to let that stop me from finding the best eats in Austin and discovering new recipes.</li>   
                <li>Modelling - Just for fun! I work with local photographers to help them try new techniques and bolster their portfolios while getting an excuse to dress up and smile for the camera.</li>
            </ul>
